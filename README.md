## COVID-19 Mental Health Analysis with Unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository contains Jupyter Notebook developed as part of a dissertation to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic, as well as clustering algorithms like K-Means and HDBSCAN, to analyze social media data from Reddit. It also includes temporal analysis to observe shifts in public opinion over time.
