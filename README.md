# COVID-19 Mental Health Analysis with Unsupervised Machine Learning

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook developed as part of a dissertation to understand the impacts of COVID-19 on mental health. The project utilizes unsupervised machine learning techniques, including Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and BERTopic, as well as clustering algorithms like K-Means and HDBSCAN, to analyze social media data from Reddit. It also includes temporal analysis to observe shifts in public opinion over time.

🚀 **Comprehensive Machine Learning Pipeline for Mental Health Analysis During COVID-19** 🧠

Welcome to the **COVID-19 Mental Health Analysis** repository! This project provides a comprehensive framework for analyzing mental health discussions on Reddit during the COVID-19 pandemic using state-of-the-art machine learning techniques.
